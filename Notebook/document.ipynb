My role was to design and implement a search functionality \\nfor navigating thousands of medical ontology terms in a 3D VR environment. I developed an \\ninverted index search, n-gram substring matching, a ranking algorithm, and fuzzy matching \\nusing Levenshtein Distance. This experience not only strengthened my technical foundation \\nin search algorithms and AI techniques, but also exposed me to research at the intersection \\nof AI, VR, and education, showing me how technology can simplify complex domains like \\nmedicine. \\n \\nBeyond research, I have worked on several projects that integrate AI/ML with interactive \\ntechnologies. My Dietary Health Prediction and Recommendation System applied machine \\nlearning models in PyTorch to provide personalized diet suggestions. I also co-developed \\nthe Virtual Herbal Garden (JadiButi), a Unity-based VR/AR project featuring a virtual tour, \\n3D herbal atlas, and AI-driven chatbot, which combined my interests in gaming, \\nvisualization, and AI-powered user interaction. These projects reflect my long-term goal of \\nexploring how AI can be integrated with immersive environments to enhance learning, \\nhealthcare, and gaming experiences. \\n \\nThe NTU Global Connect Fellowship offers a unique opportunity to engage in world-class \\nresearch, collaborate with leading faculty, and broaden my perspective by working in an \\ninternational academic environment. I am particularly excited about projects involving \\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and AI for \\nvisualization/VR, as they connect directly with my past work and my vision of building \\nintelligent, interactive systems. \\n \\nThrough this fellowship, I aim to contribute meaningfully to ongoing research at NTU, while \\nalso gaining the mentorship, resources, and global exposure necessary to shape my career \\nas an AI researcher. In the long term, I wish to pursue advanced research in AI for \\nimmersive technologies and contribute towards building intelligent systems that make \\nlearning, healthcare, and gaming more accessible and impactful. \\nPiyush Jain')]"
